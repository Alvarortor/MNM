README

Hey there, you're probably reading this if you're not super comfortable working with computers. No worries I wasn't when I started this project. Here are some tips:

1. Paths
	Paths are how a computer finds a file, basically folders within folders. If you have something saved in your downloads folder, odds are the path (accessible through the properties of a file) is something like C:\Users\Owner\Downloads.This means that when you go to the downloads folder your accessing the data from users, your account, and then your download folder. In the program this README is attached to that means the examples are a subfolder. You can navigate to different folders with \, this acts a way to connect paths. 

2. Directories
	Directories are a starting point for a program, you can do down a directory but not up. Imagine your're in the downloads folder, you can't connect to the documents folder since it's upstream. Its similar to an all thumbs are fingers, but not all fingers are thumbs situation. To choose a directory (starting point) use cd until you navigate to the correct one, this allows you to take a shorter path than you'd otherwise need. 
3. How to tell if a program actually worked?
	I tried to have the programs show error messages whenever something goes wrong, but errors can slip by without me knowing. You should always review the data and see if it makes sense. If you need to see if a file was output keep an eye on your working directory, you can always delete the file you know will be produced since it should be generated again.
